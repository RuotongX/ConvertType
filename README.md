# ConvertType
This program is used to change all file suffix in one direction. The core code is from the other person. I made a GUI for it.
The original code is from https://www.cnblogs.com/bluestorm/p/3694670.html

The reason I add JRE with this project is I make this app have exe version.
The Suffix.exe need to work with that JRE. (This exe is made by exe4j tool)
And also user can use mysetup.exe to install this program.(This exe is made by Inno Setup 6 tool)
